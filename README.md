# Android Bottom Sheet Demo

This repo is a demo of the new [bottom sheet component](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2016/02/android-support-library-232.html) from Android's support library (version `23.2.0`). The `Bottom Sheet` component is an implementation of the bottom sheet from Google's Material Design spec: [Bottom Sheets](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-sheets.html).

Since this component was just released it may not be as full featured or reliable as some existing third-party implementations. Some other options are below:
